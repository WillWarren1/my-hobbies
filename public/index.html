    <h1 class='hello-world'>Hello, World! I really like D&D 5e</h1>
    <p>
      D&D 5e stands for Dungeons and Dragons: Fifth Edition, which is a fantasy-style tabletop rpg. The game is like collaborative storytelling, with rules and dice and math. I currently play in two online campaigns, 
      one with friends from college, and another with internet strangers from around the world.
      You can make your own character. They can be anything from a jolly human monk who enjoys craft brews on the weekends, 
      to an evil dragon dude who leads a cult that believes that tickling everyone in town will summon a demon god who will 
      end the world.

    <p>
      After you've made your character, you enter the world of the DM (Dungeon Master) 
      or GM (Game Master). This is a member of your group who will run the world your and your friends'
      characters all live in. They usually don't have their own character because every other character is
       under their control. The goal is to have fun while telling a story.
